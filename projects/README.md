Engaging in practical exercises is a crucial step in the process of acquiring and solidifying new knowledge. Through practice, theoretical information becomes more comprehensible and applicable. The more exercises you complete, the better you will understand the material and gain confidence in applying it. Tackling a variety of problems and practical situations also better prepares you for real-world challenges and enhances your problem-solving skills. Therefore, make sure to perform as many practical exercises as possible to firmly embed your knowledge and abilities.
