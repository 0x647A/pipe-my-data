# Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are software engineering practices aimed at automating and streamlining the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. CI/CD helps development teams deliver software quickly and reliably, minimizing errors and accelerating response to code changes.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a practice where developers regularly merge (integrate) changes to the main repository. Each integration is verified by an automated build and testing process, allowing quick detection of errors.

**Example CI process:**
1. A developer pushes changes to the central repository.
2. The CI system detects the changes and triggers a build script.
3. Automated tests are run on the newly built version.
4. Test results are reported back to the developer who made the changes.

**Popular CI tools:**
- **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server that enables building, testing, and deploying software.
- **Travis CI**: A cloud-based CI/CD platform, particularly popular among open-source projects.
- **CircleCI**: A CI/CD service offering fast and scalable solutions, integrated with popular code repositories.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** is a practice where code changes that pass the CI process are automatically deployed to production. CD allows for frequent and reliable deployments, increasing the speed of delivering value to users.

**Example CD process:**
1. After passing CI tests, the CD system automatically deploys the new version of the application to a staging environment.
2. Additional acceptance tests may be run in the staging environment.
3. If all tests are successful, the new version of the application is deployed to the production environment.

**Popular CD tools:**
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, making deployment and scaling easier.
- **Kubernetes**: A container orchestration system that automates deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: A CI/CD service offered by Amazon Web Services, enabling automation of building, testing, and deploying code.

## Example Scripts

**Example configuration file for Jenkins (Jenkinsfile):**
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'make test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'make deploy'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Example configuration file for Travis CI (.travis.yml)**:
```yaml
language: python
python:
  - "3.8"
install:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
script:
  - pytest
deploy:
  provider: script
  script: bash deploy.sh
  on:
    branch: main
```

## Tools

### GitHub Actions vs. Jenkins

Both GitHub Actions and Jenkins are popular tools for implementing Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) in software development projects. They have similar goals but differ in their implementation, configuration, and ecosystem integration.

### GitHub Actions

**GitHub Actions** is a CI/CD tool provided by GitHub, enabling automation directly within the GitHub ecosystem. It allows users to create workflows that build, test, and deploy code right from their GitHub repositories.

**Key Features:**
- **Integration with GitHub:** Deep integration with GitHub repositories, making it seamless to trigger workflows on events such as pushes, pull requests, and issues.
- **YAML Configuration:** Workflows are defined using YAML files, which are easy to read and maintain.
- **Marketplace:** Access to a vast marketplace of pre-built actions that can be easily integrated into workflows.
- **Runner Flexibility:** Supports both GitHub-hosted runners and self-hosted runners for running workflows.
- **Matrix Builds:** Easily run jobs in parallel across multiple environments and configurations.

**Example GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml):**
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.8

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```

### Jenkins

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server widely used for CI/CD. It provides a robust and flexible platform that can be customized with various plugins to fit different use cases.

#### Key Features:

- **Plugin Ecosystem**: A large library of plugins that extend Jenkins' functionality, allowing integration with numerous tools and services.
- **Declarative and Scripted Pipelines**: Supports both declarative and scripted pipeline definitions, offering flexibility in how workflows are described.
- **Distributed Builds**: Can distribute builds and tests across multiple machines, improving performance and scalability.
- **Customizability**: Highly customizable through configuration and scripting, making it suitable for complex and specific CI/CD needs.
- **Self-Hosted**: Typically hosted on-premises or on a dedicated server, giving full control over the environment.

#### Example Jenkins Pipeline (Jenkinsfile):

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'make test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'make deploy'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
